# 📘 Facebook Desktop Application
This project is a Design Patterns Course Project built using C#, the .NET Framework 4, and WinForms. The application provides a simplified Facebook experience via the official Facebook API, showcasing a modular and maintainable architecture through the use of classic software design patterns.

# 🎯 Project Goals

Demonstrate practical use of software design patterns in a real-world scenario.

Build a responsive, modular, and maintainable desktop application.

Integrate with the Facebook API for real-time data access and user interaction.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

C#, .NET Framework 4

WinForms (Visual Studio)

Facebook API (Graph API)

Data Binding for real-time UI updates

Object-Oriented Design Principles

# 🧱 Implemented Design Patterns
The architecture incorporates multiple Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns to highlight best practices in software design:

🧩 Adapter Pattern – Standardized interaction with the Facebook API.

🏗️ Builder Pattern – Step-by-step construction of complex UI components.

🏭 Factory Method Pattern – Object creation logic encapsulated in factories.

🔄 Singleton Pattern – Ensures single instance for core services like API clients.

🎭 Strategy Pattern – Allows switching between different display or filter strategies.

📦 Decorator Pattern – Adds extra UI features dynamically without altering existing code.

# 🚀 Features

🔐 User Authentication via Facebook login.

📰 Post Feed Display – Retrieve and display recent user posts.

🖼️ Photos and Albums – View user photos directly from the application.

📝 Status Updates – Post status updates to the user's timeline.

💬 Like & Comment Interactions (optional feature if implemented).

🧩 Dynamic UI Updates – Powered by data binding for real-time responsiveness.

  ** Only Facebook developer user can Sign In, and only Facebook developer users will appear in the frinds list.
